          The computer is the mastermind! They have created a top secret code
          that you must crack.
          You are the code breaker. You must use wits and strategy to break
          the code! With each guess you make, hints are given as to how
          close your guess was!
          Your guess is made by placing four colored pegs on the board.
          The mastermind will then give you colored clues:

          <p class="red-text">A red clue:</p>
          Each red clue means you have placed the correct color, and its in
          the correct position!

          <p class="green-text">A green clue:</p>
          Each green clue means you have placed the correct color, but its not
          in the correct position!

          You have 10 turns to guess the code! If you guess the code before your
          time runs out, you win!
